        <p>Books, trains and Lions: History of the Controversial Chilean occupation<br>Of Lima in January 1881-140 years ago-, the Chilean Army occupied the capital of Peru in order to put anendto the pacific War and achivie the long-awaited cession of the rich saltpeter regions.Upon arrival, the drops found a city shaken by excesses and had to take care of domestic affairs. The Chilean presence to this dayis the subject of debate: for some there was looting, others point out that spoils of wae were taken. Chilean and Peruvian historians summoned by Culto deal with the subject and ilustrate the points to take intoaccount in still open discussion</p>

        <p>An escape from film, avant-garde and Creationism: Vicente Huidobro, when creatinng is everything. <br>
    He is the one of the capital names of Chilean poetry, and in the opinion of connoisseurs, his literature-between poetry and prose-presents sevreal features that made him dialogue with the art and the advanced trends of his time. He even maneged to patent a movement of disputed origin, where he advocated cretion without resorting to imitation. In Cult we analyze his writing, aesthetics and political activity.
